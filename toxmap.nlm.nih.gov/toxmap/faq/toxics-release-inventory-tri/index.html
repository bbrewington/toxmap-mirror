            <p>The <a href="../../glossary.html#TRI">Toxics Release Inventory</a> (TRI) is a publicly available database that contains information on toxic chemical releases and other waste management activities reported annually by certain covered industry groups as well as federal facilities. This inventory was established under a federal law called the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986 (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/epcra/what-epcra">EPCRA</a>) and was expanded by the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca">Pollution Prevention Act of 1990</a>. It requires facilities in certain industries which manufacture, process, or use significant amounts of toxic chemicals, to report annually on their releases of these chemicals. The reports contain information about the types and amounts of toxic chemicals that are released each year to the air, water, land and by underground injection, as well as information on the quantities of toxic chemicals sent to other facilities for further waste management.</p>

<p>Facilities with ten or more full-time employees that process more than 25,000 pounds in aggregate, or use greater than 10,000 pounds of any one TRI chemical, are required to report releases annually. The <a href="../../glossary.html#EPA">US EPA</a> maintains this information in the TRI. The toxics release files on the National Library of Medicine's&reg; <a href="../../glossary.html#TOXNET">TOXNET®</a> come from TRI.</p>

<p>TOXMAP uses the TRI data from the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/report-sections-2016-tri-national-analysis">2016 National Analysis</a> dataset. <a href="../../glossary.html#TOXNET">NLM TOXNET</a> uses the most current TRI data.  Data submission deadlines, data entry processes, and data quality control and review all influence the actual date of data release by both the EPA and by TOXNET.  A complete list of TRI chemicals required to be reported to the EPA can be found at their <a target="epa" href="https://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-listed-chemicals">TRI-Listed Chemicals</a> page.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> At this time, TOXMAP uses reported <b>on-site</b> releases only. <b>Some TRI chemicals have no reported releases, and so will not appear in the TRI release data or in TOXMAP.</b> All release amounts are reported in pounds except dioxin which is reported in grams.</p>

            <p>The EPA's <a href="../../glossary.html#TRI">Toxics Release Inventory</a> (TRI) program is a national database that identifies facilities, chemicals manufactured, processed and used at the identified facilities, annual amounts of chemicals released and otherwise managed (on and off site) in waste.</p>

<p>The following information is excerpted from the EPA's <A href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/factors-consider-when-using-toxics-release-inventory-data">"Factors to Consider When Using Toxics Release Inventory Data"</a>:</p>

<p>TRI data do not include release information from all sources or from other waste management activities, and all industry sectors and all chemicals are not covered. TRI data report releases and waste management of the chemicals, but do not reflect exposure information of the public to the chemicals. Only facilities meeting specific <A href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-threshold-screening-tool">criteria</A> are required to report. <br/><br/>All data in TRI (chemicals released, release amounts, etc.) is required by law to be self-reported annually, and is not validated by the EPA. In addition, some of the reporting facilities submit estimated data to TRI. (Since different estimation practices are used, the EPA has published estimation guidance for the user.)</p>

<p>TRI release estimates are one resource that can be used to evaluate exposure or calculate potential risks to human health and the environment. However, it is essential to understand that they do not, by themselves, represent risk.  The determination of potential risk depends on many factors, including toxicity, chemical fate after release, release location, and population concentrations.</p>

<p>Finally, TRI release values are specified for 17 digits after the decimal point, but TOXMAP rounds them to six digits.  NLM's <a href="https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/tri.htm">TOXNET TRI</a> displays exact values.</p>

            <p>TOXMAP uses the TRI data from the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/report-sections-2016-tri-national-analysis">2016 National Analysis</a> dataset. <a href="../../glossary.html#TOXNET">NLM TOXNET</a> uses the most current TRI data. 1987 is the first reporting year of the TRI program, but by industry convention, 1988 is the first year that TRI data is used for analysis. Data submission deadlines, data entry processes, and data quality control and review all influence the actual date of data release by both the EPA and by TOXNET.  You may download data from the 1987 TRI year <a href="https://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-2016">directly from EPA</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to the final release of a given TRI release year, EPA publishes a preliminary dataset of the upcoming release data. However, TOXNET does not update TRI data until it is final.</p>

            <p>TOXMAP plots the location of all TRI facilities and Superfund sites using addresses and coordinates from the EPA <b><a href="../../glossary.html#FRS">Facility Registry System</a></b> (FRS). The location of some of these may appear to be slightly inaccurate, because they are calculated by a geocoding estimation process. For general information about the accuracy of locations in TOXMAP, see <b><a href="../2009/08/why-are-the-locations-of-some-toxmap-facilitiessites-slightly-inaccurate.html">&quot;Why are the locations of some TOXMAP facilities slightly inaccurate?&quot;</a></b></p>

<p>The EPA recommends use of addresses and coordinates from the FRS.  TOXMAP only plots TRI facilities with defined FRS locations. Corrections to FRS are made year-round by EPA and are incorporated into TOXMAP annually with each year's publicly available data.</p>

<p>This approach avoids many errors in the TRI location data. However, there are also limitations to FRS data, such as in the case of a large facility (tens or hundreds of square miles in area) that reports to multiple EPA programs. Since FRS only uses the &quot;best&quot; of the reported coordinates, a more accurate location for a TRI release may be overlooked (e.g. the street address coordinate is used because it is easily identified as &quot;best&quot;, but the TRI release actually takes place elsewhere).</p>

<p>EPA works continuously to ensure that TRI data are accurate and reliable.  For more information, see the EPA <b><a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-data-quality">TRI Data Quality</a></b> page.</p>  Or to report a data error to EPA, please <a href="https://www.epa.gov/home/forms/contact-epa">contact EPA</a>.</p>
