            <p>The effect a chemical has on a living organism-- if any-- is called the organism's <a href="../glossary.html#Response">response</a>. The response is related to the chemical <a href="../glossary.html#Dose">dose</a> and to the resulting concentration of the chemical in the organism. The dose of a chemical often determines the extent of the effect it produces. Understanding the dose-response relationship is necessary for understanding the cause and effect relationship between chemical exposure and illness.</p>

<p>The toxicity of a substance depends on many factors:  the  form and chemical activity; the dosage, especially the dose-time relationship; exposure route; species; age; sex; ability of the chemical to be absorbed; metabolism; distribution within the body; excretion; and the presence of other chemicals.</p>

<p>The variety of responses among organisms that get the same dose of chemical is due to individual susceptibility. Dose and individual susceptibility play roles in all situations involving chemical exposure. Toxicologists study responses of living organisms to doses of chemicals.</p>

<p><b>Always keep in mind that the co-occurrence of a substance and a particular health problem does not <i>by itself</i> imply an effect on human health by that substance; the association of two or more variables (correlation) does not, by itself, imply a cause and effect relationship.</b></p>

<p>You can learn more about chemicals and toxicity with this <a href="https://toxtutor.nlm.nih.gov/">Toxicology Tutorial</a>, which covers basic toxicology, organized by chapter and offering text, graphics, and quizzes/assessments.</p>

            <p>It is difficult to answer this question simply because there is currently no standard approach to assess overall human health risk.  People are exposed to chemicals in our environment via in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the houses we live in, and the food we eat.  TRI releases and Superfund sites are just a few examples of sources of chemical exposure.</p>

<p>Some of these chemicals may affect our health.  Understanding exposure and determining whether there is a health risk is a very complex process. There are many factors that affect health risk.  A large release of one chemical might be less harmful to our health than a smaller release of another chemical; the impact of air releases can be affected by wind direction and other factors.</p>

            At this time, TOXMAP uses reported <b>on-site</b> releases only. <b>Some TRI chemicals have no reported releases, and so will not appear in the TRI release data or in TOXMAP.</b></p>

<p>Certain industries in the United States that manufacture, process, use, or transport significant amounts of specific toxic chemicals (approximately 650 chemicals and chemical categories covering about 23,000 industrial and federal facilities) are required by law to report annually on the releases of these chemicals to the EPA (through its <b><a href="../glossary.html#TRI">Toxics Release Inventory</a></b> Program). TOXMAP maps on-site releases of the listed chemicals covered by the EPA TRI program.</p>

<p>It should be noted that although facilities are required by federal law to use the best available data for their reporting, the accuracy of the reported data is unknown since it can be based on both actual measurements and on estimates. However, the Toxics Release Inventory is the best public information available on these chemicals.</p>

<p>The EPA <b><a href="../glossary.html#Superfund">Superfund Program</a></b> is part of a federal government effort to decontaminate any land in the United States that has been contaminated by hazardous waste and that has been identified by the EPA as a candidate for cleanup because it poses a risk to human health and/or the environment. The program designates more than 800 substances as hazardous, and many more as potentially hazardous to human health or to the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed.</p>

<p>The toxic chemicals reported in this way make up only a small portion of the total amount manufactured, handled and used in the United States<b>.</b></p>

<p>Industries are not the only entities responsible for toxic chemicals. Since the current reporting requirements apply only to industrial sources, sources of toxic chemicals from transportation, farming and households are not included. In addition, thousands of new chemicals are studied each year and thousands are manufactured. It is not possible to test each chemical regarding possible toxic effects on people, plants or animals.</p>

            The data found in TOXMAP comes from several providers, including:

<ul><li><b>Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)</b>
<p>A federal law called the <a target="epa" href="https://www.epa.gov/epcra/what-epcra">Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act</a> (EPCRA) requires facilities in certain industries which manufacture, process, or use significant amounts of toxic chemicals, to report annually on their releases of these chemicals. The reports contain information about the types and amounts of toxic chemicals that are released each year to the air, water, land and by underground injection, as well as information on the quantities of toxic chemicals sent to other facilities for further waste management.</p>
<p>Facilities with ten or more full-time employees that process more than 25,000 pounds in aggregate, or use greater than 10,000 pounds of any one TRI chemical, are required to report releases annually. The <a href="../glossary.html#EPA">US Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) maintains this information in a database called the <a href="../glossary.html#TRI">Toxics Release Inventory</a> (TRI). The toxics release files on the National Library of Medicine's® (NLM) <a href="../glossary.html#TOXNET">Toxicology Data Network</a> (TOXNET®) come from TRI.</p>
<p>TOXMAP uses the TRI data from the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/report-sections-2016-tri-national-analysis">2016 National Analysis</a> dataset. <a href="../glossary.html#TOXNET">NLM TOXNET</a> uses the most current TRI data.  Data submission deadlines, data entry processes, and data quality control and review all influence the actual date of data release by both the EPA and by TOXNET.  A complete list of TRI chemicals required to be reported to the EPA can be found at their <a target="epa" href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-listed-chemicals">TRI-Listed Chemicals</a> page.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> At this time, TOXMAP uses reported <b>on-site</b> releases only. <b>Some TRI chemicals have no reported releases, and so will not appear in the TRI release data or in TOXMAP.</b></p>
<p>For more information, see the <a target="nlm" href="https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/help/newtoxnet/trifs.html">TRI Fact Sheet</a>.</p></li>
<p>
<li><b>EPA's CERCLIS</b>
<p><a href="../glossary.html#CERCLIS">CERCLIS</a> contains information about <a href="../glossary.html#Superfund">Superfund</a> sites, such as the current status of cleanup efforts, cleanup milestones reached, and amounts of liquid and solid media treated at sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) or under consideration for the NPL. The CERCLIS database can be <a target="epa"  href="https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/srchsites.cfm">searched online</a>.</p></li>
<p>
<li><b>US Census</b>
<p>TOXMAP Census data from 2000 and 2010 comes directly from the <a href="https://www.census.gov">US Census</a>.

            <p>TOXMAP facility locations are calculated by an <b>estimation process</b> that relies on &quot;geocoding.&quot; Geocoding is a method that assigns latitude and longitude to an address. Even the most accurate latitude/longitude coordinate calculations, including those used by TOXMAP, are estimates; this can account for minor inaccuracies in site locations on a map.</p>
<p>Addresses are geocoded using software that accesses location information from a variety of sources which contain street segments; address ranges are attached to each side of the segment. TOXMAP's geocoding program <b>estimates</b> the location of each facility address based on this address range. Although very accurate, these locations are estimates, and they should not be used to definitively locate a particular facility.</p>

For instance, in TOXMAP click "Enter location" search box, type in a place of interest like an Indian reservation, then click the magnifying glass to search. You can also save the location for later use by clicking the "Bookmark" icon in the toolbar, then use this named "bookmark" to zoom to that location for quick reference later in your session.</p>
<p>The TOXMAP Native Lands map layer shows geographic areas of certain native populations, including American Indian Reservations and Off-Reservation Trust Lands, Alaska Native Village Statistical Areas, and Hawaiian Home Lands, as defined by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/">US Census</a>.  This layer can be toggled on and off via the Map Contents side panel.</p>

            <p>The <a href="../glossary.html#TRI">Toxics Release Inventory</a> (TRI) is a publicly available database that contains information on toxic chemical releases and other waste management activities reported annually by certain covered industry groups as well as federal facilities. This inventory was established under a federal law called the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986 (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/epcra/what-epcra">EPCRA</a>) and was expanded by the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca">Pollution Prevention Act of 1990</a>. It requires facilities in certain industries which manufacture, process, or use significant amounts of toxic chemicals, to report annually on their releases of these chemicals. The reports contain information about the types and amounts of toxic chemicals that are released each year to the air, water, land and by underground injection, as well as information on the quantities of toxic chemicals sent to other facilities for further waste management.</p>

<p>Facilities with ten or more full-time employees that process more than 25,000 pounds in aggregate, or use greater than 10,000 pounds of any one TRI chemical, are required to report releases annually. The <a href="../glossary.html#EPA">US EPA</a> maintains this information in the TRI. The toxics release files on the National Library of Medicine's&reg; <a href="../glossary.html#TOXNET">TOXNET®</a> come from TRI.</p>

<p>TOXMAP uses the TRI data from the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/trinationalanalysis/report-sections-2016-tri-national-analysis">2016 National Analysis</a> dataset. <a href="../glossary.html#TOXNET">NLM TOXNET</a> uses the most current TRI data.  Data submission deadlines, data entry processes, and data quality control and review all influence the actual date of data release by both the EPA and by TOXNET.  A complete list of TRI chemicals required to be reported to the EPA can be found at their <a target="epa" href="https://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-listed-chemicals">TRI-Listed Chemicals</a> page.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> At this time, TOXMAP uses reported <b>on-site</b> releases only. <b>Some TRI chemicals have no reported releases, and so will not appear in the TRI release data or in TOXMAP.</b> All release amounts are reported in pounds except dioxin which is reported in grams.</p>

            <p>The EPA's <a href="../glossary.html#TRI">Toxics Release Inventory</a> (TRI) program is a national database that identifies facilities, chemicals manufactured, processed and used at the identified facilities, annual amounts of chemicals released and otherwise managed (on and off site) in waste.</p>

<p>The following information is excerpted from the EPA's <A href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/factors-consider-when-using-toxics-release-inventory-data">"Factors to Consider When Using Toxics Release Inventory Data"</a>:</p>

<p>TRI data do not include release information from all sources or from other waste management activities, and all industry sectors and all chemicals are not covered. TRI data report releases and waste management of the chemicals, but do not reflect exposure information of the public to the chemicals. Only facilities meeting specific <A href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-threshold-screening-tool">criteria</A> are required to report. <br/><br/>All data in TRI (chemicals released, release amounts, etc.) is required by law to be self-reported annually, and is not validated by the EPA. In addition, some of the reporting facilities submit estimated data to TRI. (Since different estimation practices are used, the EPA has published estimation guidance for the user.)</p>

<p>TRI release estimates are one resource that can be used to evaluate exposure or calculate potential risks to human health and the environment. However, it is essential to understand that they do not, by themselves, represent risk.  The determination of potential risk depends on many factors, including toxicity, chemical fate after release, release location, and population concentrations.</p>

<p>Finally, TRI release values are specified for 17 digits after the decimal point, but TOXMAP rounds them to six digits.  NLM's <a href="https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/tri.htm">TOXNET TRI</a> displays exact values.</p>

Data submission deadlines, data entry processes, and data quality control and review all influence the actual date of data release by both the EPA and by TOXNET.  You may download data from the 1987 TRI year <a href="https://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-2016">directly from EPA</a>.</p>

            <p>TOXMAP plots the location of all TRI facilities and Superfund sites using addresses and coordinates from the EPA <b><a href="../glossary.html#FRS">Facility Registry System</a></b> (FRS). The location of some of these may appear to be slightly inaccurate, because they are calculated by a geocoding estimation process. For general information about the accuracy of locations in TOXMAP, see <b><a href="2009/08/why-are-the-locations-of-some-toxmap-facilitiessites-slightly-inaccurate.html">&quot;Why are the locations of some TOXMAP facilities slightly inaccurate?&quot;</a></b></p>

<p>The EPA recommends use of addresses and coordinates from the FRS.  TOXMAP only plots TRI facilities with defined FRS locations. Corrections to FRS are made year-round by EPA and are incorporated into TOXMAP annually with each year's publicly available data.</p>

<p>This approach avoids many errors in the TRI location data. However, there are also limitations to FRS data, such as in the case of a large facility (tens or hundreds of square miles in area) that reports to multiple EPA programs. Since FRS only uses the &quot;best&quot; of the reported coordinates, a more accurate location for a TRI release may be overlooked (e.g. the street address coordinate is used because it is easily identified as &quot;best&quot;, but the TRI release actually takes place elsewhere).</p>

<p>EPA works continuously to ensure that TRI data are accurate and reliable.  For more information, see the EPA <b><a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-data-quality">TRI Data Quality</a></b> page.</p>  Or to report a data error to EPA, please <a href="https://www.epa.gov/home/forms/contact-epa">contact EPA</a>.</p>

The NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation. The site's NPL "status" can provide more information about the site in relationship to the NPL:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Proposed:</b> Site proposed (by the EPA, the state, or concerned citizens) for addition to the NPL due to contamination by hazardous waste and identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a candidate for cleanup because it poses a risk to human health and/or the environment.</li>
<li><b>Withdrawn</b>: Site removed from the NPL because EPA has determined that it poses no real or potential threat to human health and the environment.</li>
<li><b>Final</b>: Site determined to pose a real or potential threat to human health and the environment after completion of <a href="../glossary.html#HRS">HRS</a> screening and public solicitation of comments about the proposed site.</li>
<li><b>Deleted</b>: Site deleted from the NPL by the EPA (with state concurrence) because site cleanup goals have been met and no further response is necessary at the site.</li>
